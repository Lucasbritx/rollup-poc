# Rollup.js

This project uses **Rollup.js** – a module bundler for JavaScript – to bundle modern JavaScript modules into a single file that can run in browsers or Node.js.

## 🔍 What is Rollup?

[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) is a fast and efficient module bundler that compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It's especially good at bundling ES modules (ESM) and is often used for building JavaScript libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- Tree-shaking to remove unused code
- ES Module support
- Lightweight output
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Generates multiple output formats (ESM, CommonJS, UMD, etc.)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup

## Vite
Vite uses Rollup to bundle the application for production.

## TODO list
Add SASS
Consumer using different types of CSS
Which is the easier way to use the components
